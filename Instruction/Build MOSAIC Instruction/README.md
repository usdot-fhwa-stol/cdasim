# Carla-Sumo-Mosaic Co-Simulation Tool

This user guide intends to provide users instructions on how to install the prerequisite software, configure the system environment variable, and run a Co-simulation tool developed for supporting the cooperative driving automation research on **Linux systems Ubuntu 16.04** and **Windows 10 systems**. This co-simulation tool is developed based on the open-source concept. Specifically, it is based on [Eclipse MOSAIC framework](https://www.eclipse.org/mosaic/) and consists of an open-source traffic simulator, namely [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/), an autonomous driving simulator, namely [CARLA](http://carla.org/), an open-source network simulator, namely [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/). The co-simulation tool can simulate V2X communication among vehicles and infrastructure using the ns-3 network simulator.

##  **Prerequisites**

For a successful running of the co-simulation tool, the following software must be installed or updated:

-  CARLA simulator 0.9.10
-  JAVA 8 or 11 - Recommend using the [Adopt OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8). The environment variable **JAVA_HOME** needs be configured to the location of JDK.
-  Python 3.7 - If the users use different version of Python other than 3.7, the users need to copy the CARLA library .egg file to the folder bridge/ PythonAPI /carla/dist. In addition, the package `lxml==4.5.0` needs to be installed.
-  SUMO 1.8.0 - The environment variable **`SUMO_HOME`** **must be configured to define the installation directory of SUMO**.
-  ns-3 simulator
-  TraCI library has to be updated.

Moreover, a high performance computer is needed to run the co-simulation tool. The configuration of a recommended system is in the following.

- **CPU**: Intel i7 gen 9th - 11th / Intel i9 gen 9th - 11th / AMD ryzen 7 / AMD ryzen 9
- **RAM memory:** minimum 16GB

Here the scenario configuration file, the CARLA configuration file, CARMA configuration file, Infrastructure configuration file, and bridge file are introduced in detail below. For other configuration files and scenario creation, refer to the documentation of Eclipse MOSAIC [[link](https://www.eclipse.org/mosaic/docs/)]. Moreover, the CARLA 3D maps corresponding to the scenarios must be generated for co-simulation scenarios.

### **1.**   **Scenario configuration file**

The **scenario_config.json** is the main configuration file of a co-simulation scenario. A co-simulation scenario file looks like the following example.



```json
{
  "simulation": {
   "id": "co-simulation",
   "duration": "400s",
   "randomSeed": 212323853,
   "projection": {
      "centerCoordinates": {
        	"latitude": 52.63,
        	"longitude": 13.56
      },
      "cartesianOffset": {
       	"x": -395635.35,
      	"y": -5826456.24
     }
    },
   "network": {
    		"netMask": "255.255.0.0",
    		"vehicleNet": "10.1.0.0",
    		"rsuNet": "10.2.0.0",
    		"tlNet": "10.3.0.0",
   	 	    "csNet": "10.4.0.0",
    		"serverNet": "10.5.0.0",
    		"tmcNet": "10.6.0.0",
            "carmaVehicleNet": "10.7.0.0",
	        "carlaVehicleNet": "10.8.0.0"
    }
  },
  "federates": {
  		"application": true,
  		"cell": false,
  		"environment": false,
  		"sns": false,
  		"ns3": true,
  		"omnetpp": false,
  		"output": false,
  		"carla": true,
        "carma": true,
  		"sumo": true,
        "infrastructure": true
  }
}
```

The federate tags show which simulators are  used in the simulation. For the co-simulation scenarios, CARLA and SUMO federate must be enabled. If the CARLA federate is disabled, the simulation of SUMO and MOSAIC will be run.

### **2.**   **Carla configuration file**

The CARLA ambassador can be configured with the carla configuration file. The specific path is **<scenarioName>/carla/carla_config.json**.  The example configuration files of CARLA ambassador on Linux systems and on Windows systems are shown in the following, respectively.

**Linux**

```json
{
    "updateInterval": 100,
	"carlaUE4Path": "/CARLA_0.9.10/",
	"bridgePath": "./scenarios/co-simulation/carla; bridge.sh",
	"carlaConnectionPort": 8913
}
```

**Windows**

```json
{
    "updateInterval": 100,
	"carlaUE4Path": "D:/CARLA_0.9.10/",
	"bridgePath": "./scenarios/co-simulation/carla; bridge.bat",
	"carlaConnectionPort": 8913
}
```

The following table descripts the parameters in the CARLA configuration file.

| Parameters          | **Type** | **Description**                                              | **Required** |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| updateInterval      | number   | The Interval after which the CARLA is updated.  The default unit is ms. Define the size  of one simulation step in CARLA. The updateInterval of Carla and Sumo  ambassador must be the same.  **Note**: the minimal value of updateInterval is 100ms and the default setting of updateInterval being predefined in the java code is 1000ms for both carla and sumo configuration. | Yes          |
| carlaUE4Path        | string   | Path to CarlaUE4 executable file (Windows systems: CarlaUE4.exe; Linux systems: CarlaUE4.sh). If the environment  variable **`CARLA_HOME`** is configured to define  the installation directory of CarlaUE4 executable file, this parameter can be removed from  the configuration file. | No           |
| bridgePath          | string   | This parameter includes two information separated by the  semicolon. The first substring is the path of bridge .sh or .bat. The second  substring is the file name of bridge .sh or .bat. The extension of the bridge file is needed. | Yes          |
| carlaConnectionPort | number   | The bridge server port . It must be the same as  the bridge server port number in the bridge .sh or .bat file.  If the entry is not used, the default port number is 8913. | No           |

### **3.**  **Bridge file**

The bridge file (bridge.sh or bridge.bat) is used to run the bridge to connect CARLA simulator and CARLA ambassador, load maps to CARLA simulator, pass messages between CARLA ambassador and CARLA simulator. The examples of  bridge files on Linux systems and on Windows systems are shown in the following, respectively.

**Linux system**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cd ../../../bridge

x-terminal-emulator python3.7 carla_mosaic_bridge.py --bridge-server-port 8913 --map Town04 ../scenarios/Town04/sumo/Town04.net.xml --step-length 0.1
```

 **Windows system**

```powershell
@ECHO OFF
cd ../../../bridge
python carla_mosaic_bridge.py --bridge-server-port 8913 --map Town04 ../scenarios/Town04/sumo/Town04.net.xml --step-length 0.1
```

The arguments in the above python commands are shown in the following.

**`--bridge-server-port 8913`:** The port number that the bridge server is listening to. It must be the same as the carlaConnectionPort in the carla configuration file. If not specified, the default port number 8913 will be used for the bridge server.

**`--map Tow04`**: the map loaded in the CARLA simulator. If not specified, the default map of CARLA simulator will be used.

**`../scenarios/Town04/sumo/Town04.net.xml`**: the net file of the CARLA map or SUMO, the net file is located in the net folder under the bridge folder. Since SUMO and CARLA simulator use different reference systems,  the SUMO net offset calculated from the net file is used to calculate the transform of SUMO actors in CARLA simulator and the transform of CARLA actors in SUMO. If not specified, the net file will be generated using the CARLA map.

**--step-length**: the simulation step length, which should be the same as the updateInterval of CARLA.

### 4. CARMA Configuration File

The CARMA ambassador can be configured with the CARMA configuration file. The specific path is **<scenarioName>/carma/carma_config.json**. An example configuration files of CARMA ambassador is shown in the following.

```

## **Run a Co-simulation Scenario**

To run a co-simulation scenario via Command Line Interface, call the start script with the following command line arguments. For more CLI options, please refer to Eclipse MOSAIC documentation. After CARLA loads map and SUMO GUI pops out, click the play button in SUMO GUI to start running co-simulation.

**GNU/Linux**

```
./mosaic.sh -s <scenario-name>
./mosaic.sh -c ./scenarios/<scenario_name>/scenario_config.json
```

**Windows**

```
mosaic.bat -s <scenario-name>
mosaic.bat -c .\scenarios\<scenario_name>\scenario_config.json
```

**Example**

The following call starts the co-simulation scenario “Co-simulation” on a Linux Machine.

```
./mosaic.sh -s Co-simulation -v -w 0
```

The following call starts the co-simulation scenario “Tow04” on a Windows Machine.

```
mosaic.bat -s Co-simulation -v -w 0
```

 ![co-simulation demo](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-simulation/blob/feature/mosaic-carla-sumo-ambassadors/co-simulation%20tool/co-simulation%20demo.gif)

## **Check the Log Files**

Log files are generated for the used ambassadors for each simulation run. They are stored in the folder `<cosimulation-root>/logs/log-<timestamp>-scenarioname`. Each simulation run has a  new log file folder generated. The folder structure of log file folder looks like the following. The log file Carla.log is about CARLA ambassador.

```
└─ log-<timestamp>-secarioname
  Apps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the folder for logs of applications
  ├─ Application.log .......... Information about the application ambassador
  ├─ Carla.log ...................... CARLA ambassador log  
  ├─ Carma.log ...................... CARMA ambassador log        
  ├─ Cell.log ....................... Cellular network log
  ├─ Communication.log ......... (Ad hoc) network simulation ambassador log
  ├─ CommunicationDetails.log ........ (Ad hoc) network simulation detail log
  ├─ Environment.log ................ Logs of the environmental eventserver
  ├─ Infrastructure.log ................ Infrastructure ambassador log
  ├─ Mapping.log .................... Mapping configuration logs
  ├─ MOSAIC.log ...... General information, e.g. startup sequence information
  ├─ Navigation.log ......... Detailed logs about navigation component in the         application ambassador
  ├─ output.csv ....... Recorded data of the integrated File Output Generator
  ├─ RunTimeEvents.csv .............. Logs of run time events
  ├─ Traffic.log .................... Traffic simulation log (SUMO)

```

##  Troubleshooting

If the maps of CARLA for the scenarios is the same as the default map of CARLA simulator, the argument about map in the bridge file is recommended to be removed. Loading a map in CARLA simulator takes time and sometimes may break the connection of CARLA client. The users need restart the co-simulation to solve the connection issue.

Sometimes, the CARLA client may not be connected to CARLA simulator. Check whether there is a CARLA process running in the background or not. If so, terminate the CARLA process.

During the simulation, change the view of spectator may cause the CARLA simulator freeze. Users should adjust the view of spectator before starting the co-simulation.

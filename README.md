# CARMASimulation
This repository will host the CARMA Everything-in-the-Loop Co-Simulation tool. This XiL simulation platform will support CARLA and SUMO simulation environments as a co-simulation using the MOSAIC framework to facilitate coordination and data exchange. This co-simulation environment will also utilize NS-3 to simulate the communications used by the C-ADS systems.

The current version and release history can be found here: [Release Notes](<docs/Release_notes.md>)

/**
 * This is a simple application to demonstrate a concurrency task.
 * In your scenario may exist many vehicles (e.g. veh_0, veh_1, veh_2, ...).
 * This application demonstrates the following behavior:
 * <p>
 * veh_0, veh_1, veh_2, ... start a thread
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * veh_0, veh_1, veh_2, ... do some logic parallel to each other (e.g. difficult calculations independent from each other)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * veh_0, veh_1, veh_2, ... join the thread
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This will be an advantage by difficult tasks because RTI shouldn't wait for each vehicle to complete the calculation task.
